**LLM Document Trees: A Unified Approach to Research Management**

**LLM Document Trees** is an experimental system that automates and self-organizes research using large language models (LLMs) within a graph-based document structure. It represents research as a growing tree of interconnected entries, allowing the LLM to propose new ideas, questions, and findings based on existing content. This setup combines the generative power of LLMs with a structured representation to manage complexity and drive new insights.

**Key Features:**

- **Unified Tree Structure**: The system employs a tree-based architecture across multiple domains:
  - Document Management: Research entries form a hierarchical graph, allowing for flexible knowledge organization.
  - Code Edits: A tree-based representation of code structures enables precise modifications and refactoring.
  - Conversation Management: Dialogues with the LLM are structured as conversation trees, preserving context and allowing for branching discussions.

- **Massive Personal Knowledge Base**: The system currently manages a personal document collection of approximately 4 million tokens, demonstrating its capability to handle large-scale, long-term research projects.

- **Interactive Interface**: A responsive interface built with Streamlit lets users explore and expand the document tree, viewing the relationships between different entries.

- **Self-Growth through LLMs**: The system allows LLMs to autonomously expand the graph by adding new entries based on existing nodes, creating a constantly evolving repository of insights and ideas.

- **Code Modification and Execution**: Integrated features for modifying and executing code directly within the research environment, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

**Background and Inspiration**

The inspiration for this approach comes from the need to organize research and ideas over time, in a format that allows both growth and a clear overview of relationships. It's designed to address the challenges of both divergence (expanding ideas) and convergence (synthesizing and organizing), while also integrating code development and experimentation into the research process.

**Why Share?**

I've shared a preview of this work as it represents an intersection of personal knowledge management, code development, and LLMs that hasn't been fully explored before. The system's ability to manage a large-scale personal knowledge base of 4 million tokens demonstrates its potential for long-term, complex research projects.

While I won't be releasing data or code at this point, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the idea. Could this unified approach to research management, combining document organization, code development, and LLM-driven exploration, resonate with your projects or lead to new ways of working with LLMs?

Feel free to share any ideas or feedbackâ€”this is very much an evolving concept!
