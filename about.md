description: Stanford CS PhD developing information-theoretic mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth.
---

I'm a CS PhD at Stanford working on **scalable oversight**—information-theoretic mechanisms to evaluate AI systems **without ground truth**, with guarantees under strategic manipulation.

### Research
My recent work introduces an information-theoretic framework for **black-box LLM evaluation without ground truth**, bridging mechanism design and practical evaluation. In theory and experiments, the approach yields **10–100× higher robustness** to adversarial manipulation than prior methods ([arXiv:2508.05469](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.05469), Aug 2025). In submission; received feedback from mechanism design experts (e.g., [Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/)).

**Field response.** Within weeks of the arXiv release, several labs initiated alternative evaluation platforms—underscoring the urgency of this direction.

### Impact & Recognition
- **Early adoption:** ICML 2024 highlight; initial production deployments ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/florian-h%C3%B6nicke-b902b6aa_icml-icml24-icml2024-activity-7224064255677849601-wdgS))
- **Academic influence:** Helped catalyze new lines of work on scalable oversight across multiple institutions
- **Open science:** Preregistration ([OSF](https://osf.io/c7pum)), code, and complete proofs

### Research Leadership & Funding
- **Lead author and primary researcher**, OpenAI Superalignment Fast Grant ($500k, 2024). I conceived, wrote, and secured the agenda; executed framework from proposal to validation
- **Advocacy:** Led *WellLabeled* (Stanford HAI) on data annotation worker rights; interviews with Turkopticon, Scale AI, and OpenAI; featured by Stanford HAI ([article + video](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/exploring-complex-ethical-challenges-data-annotation), Jul 2024) and invited talk at FloodGate.
- **First-author** theoretical and empirical contributions connecting mechanism design to ML evaluation
