I am a CS PhD student at Stanford. I obtained a masters degree in CS from UIUC. My undergraduate major was Computational and Applied Mathematics at University of Chicago. I have a variety of research interests in machine learning. I'm particularly motivated by questions surrounding human incentives and the creation of human compatible AI. I'm also interested in imitation learning, generative models, and learning theory as well.
