I am a CS PhD student at Stanford. I obtained a masters degree in CS from UIUC. My undergraduate major was Computational and Applied Mathematics at University of Chicago. My main research focus is undefined. Currently, it lies at the intersection of decision theory and human-centered AI. I'm interested in imitation learning, generative models, and learning theory as well.
