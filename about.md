I am a CS PhD student at Stanford. I obtained a masters degree in CS from UIUC. My undergraduate major was Computational and Applied Mathematics at University of Chicago. I have a variety of research interests in machine learning. I'm particularly motivated by questions around creating human compatible AI. I'm interested in imitation learning, generative models, and learning theory as well.
