I am a CS PhD student at Stanford's [STAIR lab](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu/), where we are working on AI superalignment with support from an OpenAI award. My research focuses on developing scalable oversight mechanisms and aligning AI systems with human preferences, drawing from mechanism design, information theory, and complex systems to create principled frameworks for human-AI collaboration. I have a strong theoretical background in optimization, learning theory, and probability theory, with experience integrating language models and reasoning to process complex information. I place a strong emphasis on rigorous empirical evaluation through ablation studies, benchmark development, and human-in-the-loop experiments. Prior to Stanford, I obtained a masters in CS from UIUC and a bachelor's in Computational and Applied Mathematics from University of Chicago. I am broadly driven by the goal of developing safe, reliable, and human-aligned AI systems.
