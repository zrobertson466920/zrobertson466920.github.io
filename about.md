I am a CS PhD student working with Sanmi Koyejo in [STAIR lab](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu), where we are working on trustworthy AI. My research focuses on developing scalable oversight mechanisms and aligning AI systems with human preferences, drawing from mechanism design, information theory, and complex systems to create principled frameworks for human-AI collaboration.

Recently, I developed information-theoretic mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth, proving that f-mutual information measures uniquely resist gaming while maintaining high discrimination between faithful and deceptive agents. This work demonstrates 10-100× better robustness to adversarial manipulation than current LLM judges and has attracted significant attention from the research community.

Prior to Stanford, I obtained a masters in CS from UIUC and a bachelor's in Computational and Applied Mathematics from University of Chicago. I have gained diverse research experience through internships at Google, where I designed tractable surrogates for welfare maximization with applications in ad click-through-rate prediction; Lam Research, optimizing semiconductor wafer production using reinforcement learning; and the Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab at TTIC, working on sparse-depth completion and natural language instruction following for robotic manipulation.
